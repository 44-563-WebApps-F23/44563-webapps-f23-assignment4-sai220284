<h1>Hello, I am Sai Teja Gangisetti</h1>

<h2>ACT II by Henrik Ibsen</h2>


      <p class="direction">[THE SAME SCENE.—THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
      stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
      dishevelled branches. NORA’S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She
      is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and
      takes up her cloak.]_ </p>

            <p class="direction">[drops her cloak]</p>
            <p>Someone is coming now!</p>
            <p class="direction">[Goes to the door and listens.]</p>
            <p>No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—</p>
            <p class="direction">[opens the door and looks out.]</p>
            <p>No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty.</p>
            <p class="direction">[Comes forward.]</p>
            <p>What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little children.</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>
            <p class="direction">[doing so]</p>
            <p>But it is very much in want of mending.</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA:</strong></p>
            <p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>
       
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>
            <p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA:</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>
            <p>What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am, and make yourself ill.</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA:</strong></p>
            <p>Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>
            <p>The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA.</strong></p>
            <p> Do they ask much for me?</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE.</strong></p>
            <p> You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA.</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I was before.</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE.</strong></p>
            <p> Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.</p>
        
            <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA.</strong></p>
            <p> Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she
                  went away altogether?</p>
        
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>Nurse:</strong></p>
            <p> Good heavens!—went away altogether?</p>
       
            <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NORA.</strong></p>
            <p>Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about—how could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?</p>
