    <p>I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora’s nurse.</p>

    <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA:</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?</p>

    <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>    
    <p>What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor girl who
        has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked man didn’t
        do a single thing for me.</p>
    
    <p class="speech nora"><strong>NORA:</strong></p>
    <p>But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.</p>

    <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>   
    <p>No, indeed she hasn’t. She wrote to me when she was confirmed, and when
        she was married.</p>

    <p>Dear old Anne, you were a good mother to me when I was little.</p>

    <p class="speech Nurse"><strong>NURSE:</strong></p>    
    <p>Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.</p>
